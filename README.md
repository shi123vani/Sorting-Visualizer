# Sorting-Visualizer

Sorting algorithms are used to rearrange a collection of elements in a specific order, such as ascending or descending order. There are several sorting algorithms available, including bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, 
merge sort, quicksort, and heapsort.

# Bubble-Sort:-

Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. It gets its name from the way smaller elements "bubble" to the top of the list as the algorithm progresses.

# Methodology: 
The algorithm works as follows: 
1. Starting from the first element, compare the current element with the next element. 
2. If the current element is greater than the next element, swap them. 
3. Move to the next pair of elements and repeat step 2.
4. Continue this process until the end of the list is reached. 
5. Repeat steps 1-4 for each element in the list.

# Insertion-Sort:-

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that sorts an array or list of elements by repeatedly iterating over the list and inserting each element in its correct position in a sorted sub-list. 

# Methodology: 
The algorithm works as follows: 
1. Start with the first element of the list and assume it is sorted. 
2. Iterate over the list, starting with the second element. For each element, compare it with all the elements in the sorted sub-list that come before it and insert it at the correct position. 
3. Repeat step 2 until all the elements are sorted.

# Selection-Sort:- 
The selection sort algorithm is a simple sorting algorithm that sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and placing it at the beginning. 
The algorithm maintains two subarrays in a given array. 
a. The subarray which is already sorted. 
b. Remaining subarray which is unsorted. 
 
In every iteration of the selection sort, the minimum element from the unsorted subarray is picked and swapped with the leftmost element of the unsorted subarray. The leftmost element is then 
considered sorted, and the process continues until the entire array is sorted. 

# Methodology: 
The step-by-step methodology of implementing the selection-sort algorithm: 
1. Set the first element as the minimum. 
2. Compare the minimum element with the second element. If the second element is smaller than the minimum, set the second element as the new minimum. 
3. Repeat step 2 for the rest of the elements in the array. 
4. Swap the minimum element with the first element of the array. 
5. Repeat steps 1 through 4 for the remaining elements of the array.
